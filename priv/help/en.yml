    Classes are simply starting templates. They provide you with a set of skills that get
    you going for your first few levels of the game. After that you train the skills you
    want to gain. You can keep going with your class's theme or switch it up.

    Each experience point you gain can be used to train new skills. Each skill costs
    1000 experience if it is the same level as you. For every level below yours it
    costs 100 experience less, down to a minimum of 100 experience. See {command}help train{/command}
    for more information about training skills.

    There is no auto combat. You must {command}target{/command} a character before being able to use {command}skills{/command}
    on them. You can also use and target at the same time. Your target will be filled
    automatically when an enemy (player or otherwise) targets you.

    Make sure you view what {command}skills{/command} you have before attacking anything.

    Examples:
    [ ]> {command}skills{/command}

    [ ]> {command}target bandit{/command}
    [ ]> {command}slash{/command}

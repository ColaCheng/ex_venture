# Web Client

A basic web client is available to connect and play immediately. You can launch this by clicking the large `Play Now` buttons on the home page. It is also suggested to first sign in outside of the game so the web client immediately connects as that character.

The web client has a few features. It uses [GMCP][gmcp] through web sockets in order to have stat bars at the bottom. The sidebar contains basic information about the current room you are in: Name, exits, PCs, and NPCs. At the bottom of the sidebar is a mini map of the zone. This is a 5x5 map centered on your character.

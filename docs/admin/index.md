The dashboard has a few counters for users, items, zones, and rooms. It also has a panel showing the currently connected users, which you can teleport your user to.

### Disconnect Players

You can click the orange "Disconnect Players" to boot all connected players from the game. This will provide a message to the player that they will be disconnected shortly, providing them time to quit themselves. This can be useful for server upgrades.

### Teleporting

Clicking "Teleport to" will transport your player character to that other character's game location. If you are signed into the game your player teleport live.

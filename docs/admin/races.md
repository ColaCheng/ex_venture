# Races

![Races Index](/images/admin-races-index.png)

Races in ExVenture are entirely created by the admin panel. The seeds ship with several but can be edited. When a new character is created a race is first selected. This sets their starting statistics.

## Create a new Race

From the index page, click `New Race` in the top right of the listing.

## Edit a Race

From the index page, click on `View` for the race you wish to edit.
